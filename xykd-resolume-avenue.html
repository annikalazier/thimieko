I know i can contact their tech support but im low on time. Im runnning Avenue 6 on Osx 10.10.5 I barely do anything like play two clips or open preferences. Are there some key things i should look out for? Its licensed but i just got it. Looks easy cause i normally Resolume Avenue VJ Software - Avenue is an instrument for VJs, AV performers and video artists.

Hey guys, i got invited to play at an event thats bigger than what im used to. Moving up in the world and its most exciting :) They are supplying led light boards to use during the show. As of now, ive only ever used my projector. I looked into it and it seems that resolume has the ability to control led boards, but im not sure if its an arena vs avenue thing? Might be a problem because im currently only using avenue but have been thinking of upgrading if needed. Also, would  So I'm running resolume and was curious about something. Is there a way to switch all the dynamic effects parameters from the external audio to composition at once? I'm going nuts individually switching clips/layers's dynamic effects input from external-gtcomp and vice versa. any nudge in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. I need to format my drive and put in a new operating system. Is there any way to back up the project's effects I'm using on my clips to preserve my sets? Thanks. 
 Not a vj, but just got avenue for making a playlist for madmapper. When I transition from one clip to the next, it starts the clip over before transitioning to the next. Is there a way to transition before the clip ends. Not all of my clips are loopable so it jumps before it transitions. Have been dj-ing for a little while now (cdjs), but got a chance to try my hand at visuals for a mate's party! The dj will be playing on a traktor s2, and i was wondering if anyone could offer me advice for getting a midi clock output from the traktor and using that to control the bpm of resolume. What sort of cabling will i need? is this at all feasible? Thanks in advance. So I was wondering does anyone know if there is a way to connect ableton live to resolume avenue for windows? For mac's I know you can use OSCulator to link them but does anyone have any idea's for windows? Thanks. I'm playing around with Avenue with my Launchpad and some Beeple clips at the moment but I would like to know what the difference between the two is. Thanks. Hello, First off, Resolume avenue is AMAZING! But I'm having one problem with it. I'm using it to project videos onto a wall, but I can't split the output. In other words, I can't get the projector to just display the finished product. If I want to change clips or edit them, then I have to go back to the interface, and that's what everyone sees on the projector. I tried going to setting but there is only one option for output. Do I need another monitor? How do I fix this? In case it's impor. Hello again, I wrote here some months ago and got great responses regarding workflow and the industry. Gearing up to buy software to prepare for some shows (I perform music and want to improve the visual aspect). Having never used VJ software proper, but working daily with After Effects and Ableton and so on. I have a problem to decide what to choose, Resolume Avenue, Arena or VDMX. With regards to Resolume Avenue, I fear it might be a bit limited. Arena is above my budget currently Resolume 5 comes in 2 editions. Avenue is the VJ software you know and love, Arena has all the features of Avenue plus features you'd expect from a media server, soft edging, screen warping, DMX input and SMPTE timecode input. Resolume Avenue can play multiple layers of full HD without skipping a beat and it can handle multiple live inputs to make it a virtual video mixing desk.

Hello! Am using Resolume Avenue 6 and got a notification to update it, which I did, and since the external FFT doesn't work! Checked all the stuff, in settings it does give me the option of my output but still nothing. Just tried downgrading it too and still no luck. Got an important gig in a few days, safe to say this isn't ideal ha. Help, please. Hello All, I've ran quite a few shows running full screen for VJing. I have a little show i am working on setting up and am very interested in running a few panels for projections mapping. thinking 3-5 rectangle panels running along with some minimal lighting. I run resolume avenue and am in early stages of messing with mapping. Any one else run shows similar to this? i'd be interested to see how some others approached this type of mapping. Were you able to do most of this using only resolum. Total budget and country of purchase: USA ,200 Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I want the best specifications for the money. Battery life would be nice as well, but is less important. Highest to Lowest priority, for spec's: CPU, Good onboard soundcard (for outdoor amp headphones work), good video card, Fast WIFI connection, Internal drive storage options (I really would. I've done a few gigs using Resolume Avenue, but I've always had to set the timecode manually, and it's a massive pain keeping it in synch. I think I should be able to do better, but don't really know where to start. 1) Can I take a Midi timecode from the DJ? 2) Is this something that is driven by Traktor/Ableton and taken from the DJs laptop, or is it a hardware output from the controller? 3) What sort of cabling will I need? My laptop pretty much only has USBs on it. Do I need any other. Hey guys, I see this community is pretty small but I'm reaching out as far as I can because I have exhausted all help from the Resolume customer support. I'm experiencing a memory leak with Resolume Arena like nothing I've seen before. I have installed multiple versions of Arena with all having the same memory issue. Upon opening Arena (regardless of content loaded or not loaded) the task manager reports that the memory usage climbs from around 198mb to 18,000 mb where it will crash soon after. gt What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. I'd like to put together a PC that can serve a number of purposes: 1.) I'd like to run a HDMI to my TV for gaming. Would like gaming capabilities to run at 1080 at a minimum of 30FPS on high (or very high if feasible) settings. Would like to run current AAA games at these settings, Witcher 3, Rise of the Tomb Raider, etc. Would Hey guys, I'm looking for a solid desktop PC to do Video Editing and Live Video Mixing, also 3D work/animation. It should be kind of transportable. Is it possible to have a mini tower which either can be taken on board of an airplane or get checked in and surviving the journey? I had a Mac for several years but for budget reasons, I'm switching back to the PC, I don't see any huge advantages except for comfort anymore. I'm kinda struck by the sheer amount of options 
I literally just started using Resolume Avenue less than a month ago and I am hooked! I really want to start making my own VJ clips, but don't know what software is ideal for a beginner. Any and all feedback is welcome. Thanks.
